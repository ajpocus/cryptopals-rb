# cryptopals-rb

This repo contains a partial solution to the challenges at [cryptopals.com](https://cryptopals.com). I just open sourced it, as I write the first draft of this README, as a sample of the Ruby I've written in the past. I'd probably write this code differently now, but that probably goes for any code I wrote more than a year ago. Full disclosure, I dont know if this code will run or if the tests pass offhand -- it's been a while. If you have any questions, though, my email is on [my profile](https://github.com/ajpocus). Feel free to reach out!
